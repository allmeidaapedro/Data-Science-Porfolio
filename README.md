## PROJECTS


## CLASSIFICATION


### [**German Bank's Credit Scoring**](https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Credit-Scoring-German-Bank)

- This is an end-to-end machine learning project (from data collection to deploy) that uses Random Forest to assign credit scores to potential customers of a German bank.
- By doing so, it can make informed decisions, protecting Return on Investment (ROI) while minimizing credit risk.
- I estimated financial results calculating ROI using the expected revenue from non-defaulters' loans, the expected loss from defaulters' loans, and the total credit amount lent before the solution and after changing the bank's credit policy from my credit scoring model. Finally, after extending credit only to customers with a credit score of 600 or higher, the ROI increased from 9.55% to 42.64%.

### [**Credit Card Churn Prediction**](https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Churn-Prediction-Credit-Card)

- This is an end-to-end machine learning project (from data collection to deploy) that utilizes XGBoost to predict customer's probability of churning in a bank's credit card service.
- Identifying likely churners helps plan strategies for retention, maintaining healthy revenue. Acquiring a new customer is costlier than keeping one. 
-  The main objectives were: Identify the factors associated with customer churn; construct a model capable of predicting as many potential churners as possible; offer action plans for the bank to reduce credit card customer churn.
- It was possible to achieve an estimated gain of $198,098.82 by calculating the difference between the true positive gain, the cost of retaining false positives and the cost of false negatives churning.

## REGRESSION / TIME SERIES FORECASTING

### [**Store Item Demand Forecasting**](https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Store-Item-Demand-Forecasting)
- In this project, I performed time series forecasting using LightGBM to predict sales for 50 items across 10 different stores in a 3-month period.
- By doing this, the company will be able to strategically manage inventory and allocate resources effectively, maximizing overall revenue and profit. 
- The financial result per store, per store and item and for the total company is present inside the project.

## CLUSTERING

### [**Retail Store's Customer Segmentation and Fidelity Program**](https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Customer-Segmentation-Retail)
- In this project, I performed an unsupervised learning clustering task using K-Means on unlabeled training data to segment and profile customers for a retail store.
- After segmenting the clients, a loyalty program called "Prosperous" was developed based on the profile of our best customers, the Prosperous ones. 
- The loyalty program has the potential to increase the total store revenue by 9%, amounting to $125,228.55. Therefore, the project is worthwhile.

## EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS

### [**Olist Store**](https://github.com/allmeidaapedro/Olist-Analysis)
- In this project, I performed an exploratory data analysis of a Brazilian e-commerce company, Olist. Some business questions were formulated and answered through techniques involving data collection, cleaning, exploration, and visualization.
- Some interesting business questions that have been answered include:
- 1. The sales grew over the two years, reaching their peak in November 2017, likely due to Black Friday. Furthermore, it is noticeable that after this peak in 2017, sales tend to maintain at a high number compared to previous years.

- 2. The states in the South and Southeast regions concentrate the highest numbers of orders, customers, and sellers. Particularly, the state of São Paulo and its capital exhibit values higher than all others. Meanwhile, states in the North and Northeast regions show the lowest indicators.

## IN DEVELOPMENT 
- I am currently working with real public data from my country, conducting an exploratory data analysis of ENEM data - the most renowned exam for high school students in Brazil.
